# e-halo
e-halo was our team project for the UofT Hacks VII hackathon in January 2020. It is a mobile app which helps users to stop their vaping addictions.

## Purpose
Many people around the world are addicted to vaping and there is not enough research behind the long term health effects. This app helps people quit vaping by including a calendar that tracks users' vaping activity, streaks to encourage consistency, shows analytics on improvement, has a leaderboard for friendly competition with friends, and a personalized profile.

## Making the App
We used Java and Android Studio to create the mobile app and Adobe Illustrator to create the UI design.
